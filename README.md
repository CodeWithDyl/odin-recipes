# odin-recipes
Initial structure for odin-recipes directory  
Im going to create an index.html file
then, fill usual boilerplate and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes" to the body.
just finished the images up and everything is very rough but done,
waiting for TOP to go through with css so I can make it all pretty.
CARRY ON!
